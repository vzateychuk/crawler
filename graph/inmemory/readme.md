# In-memory graph implementation

The in-memory Graph interface implementation will serve as a gentle introduction to writing a complete graph store implementation. 
By virtue of maintaining the graph in memory, this implementation is simple, self-contained, and safe for concurrent access. 
This makes it an ideal candidate for writing unit tests that require access to the link graph component.
